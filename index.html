<h1>Ayr and Beyond: Castles, Poetry and Seaside Walks</h1>

<p>If you ever travel to the west coast of Scotland, you should definitely stop in Ayr. It’s a small and cosy town, but it has so much to offer. The first place to visit is Ayr Beach. It’s wide, sandy and perfect for a walk in the fresh sea air. On a sunny day, you can even see the Isle of Arran across the water – it looks magical.</p>

    <p>Ayr is also full of history and culture. The town is closely connected to Robert Burns, Scotland’s national poet. In nearby Alloway, you can explore the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum and walk across the Brig o’ Doon, a bridge made famous by his poetry. It feels like stepping back in time.</p>

    <p>One of my favourite trips from Ayr is to Culzean Castle. It sits on top of a cliff, with gardens, woodland and sea views that are simply stunning. It’s one of those places where you can spend a whole day just exploring.</p>

    <p>If you enjoy being active, Ayrshire is perfect for golf, cycling and long coastal walks. And if you want an adventure, take the ferry to the Isle of Arran – people often call it “Scotland in miniature” because it has mountains, beaches and castles all in one place.</p>
